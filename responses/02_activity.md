# Input Statements

---

| Now, we know how to tell something the user, but how do we know what the user is telling us?

| There are a few ways of getting user input like mouse clicks, pressed keys and scroll wheel.

| But lets start simple. Our 

| So let's get started

[Get python here](https://python.org)

### What you will need to do this course

Here are a few important things you will need for this activity.

1. You will need to know how to use github:

    - [ ] Create repositories
  
    - [ ] Use issues
  
    - [ ] Edit files
  
    - [ ] Create branches, pull requests, merges and commits
  
    - [ ] use the command line

2. You will need python3 [Get Python3 Here](https://python.org)

3. You will need a text editor, A good one is atom [Get Atom Here](https://www.atom.io)

3. You will need all the git and git commands

4. You need to know the basics of Python:
   - [ ] Use output commands using the print function
   - [ ] Use the # sign to comment in the code
         This # sign is for writing stuff that the interpreter does not look at
         These are called comments. You use them for writing down titles and stuff or for not using code but keping it.
         The python interpreter will not use the lines that start with the # sign.


## Our second part part.

Next, we need to know what peoples age is.

The way we do this in pyton is by using a keyboard input statement

The input statement takes in some keyboard input and saves it in a variable

This is what an input statement looks like

`<varname> = input("<YourQuestion>")`

Examples:

 `name = input("What's your name?")`
 
 `name2 = name + 32`
 
 `print(name2)`


### :keyboard: Activity: Getting the user's age

1. Clone the branch
2. Open the file Handling_Data/Input-Output.py
3. In a new line, input the user's age into a variable called age
4. This statement should ask How old are you
