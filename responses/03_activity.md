### What you will need to do this course

Here are a few important things you will need for this activity.

1. You will need to know how to use github:

    - [ ] Create repositories
  
    - [ ] Use issues
  
    - [ ] Edit files
  
    - [ ] Create branches, pull requests, merges and commits
  
    - [ ] use the command line

2. You will need python3 [Get Python3 Here](https://python.org)

3. You will need a text editor, A good one is atom [Get Atom Here](https://www.atom.io)

3. You will need all the git and git commands

4. You need to know the basics of Python:
   - [ ] Use output commands using the print function
   - [ ] Use the # sign to comment in the code
         This # sign is for writing stuff that the interpreter does not look at
         These are called comments. You use them for writing down titles and stuff or for not using code but keping it.
         The python interpreter will not use the lines that start with the # sign.
   - [ ] Use input statements as variables


## Our third part.

In our first part, we will be making an age program, but the first thing we need to do is tell what we are doing.

Next, we need to find the user's age.

We just do this by subtracting the age from the current year


`<varname> = <data>`

Examples:

 `name = "puku"`
 
 `greet = "hello"`
 
 `sentence = greet + ", " + name`
 
 `print(sentence)`
