# Let's get Started

---


Now we will get started. Python is a programming language. Using it, you can give the computer a set of instructions that tell it what to do.

Using python, you can make many things like apps, games, even robots. But as our first goal, we should start simple.

Lets start by creating a simple program that can tell when you were born by knowing your age.

So let's get started

[Get python here](https://python.org)

### What you will need to do this course

Here are a few important things you will need for this course.

1. You will need to know how to use github:

    - [ ] Create repositories
  
    - [ ] Use issues
  
    - [ ] Edit files
  
    - [ ] Create branches, pull requests, merges and commits
  
    - [ ] use the command line

2. You will need python3 [Get Python3 Here](https://python.org)

3. You will need a text editor, A good one is atom [Get Atom Here](https://www.atom.io)

3. You will need all the git and git commands


## Our first part.

In our first part, we will be making an age program, but the first thing we need to do is tell what we are doing.

So the best way to start is by putting down what our program is about.

The way we do his in pyton is by using a print statement

This is what a print statement looks like

`print("<YourText>")`

Examples:

 `print("mytext")`
 
 `print(150 + 20)`


### :keyboard: Activity: Introducing our program

1. Create a branch of this repository
2. Clone the branch
3. Open the file Handling_Data/Input-Output.py
4. Replace the statement  `print("Hi Everybody!")` with a print stayement.
5. This statement should say Welcome to the age app!
